# Advanced debugging with git
## (or simply: git unfuck)

---

class: center, middle, .left

# It’s all about:


1. git bisect
2. git blame
3. git cherry-pick



---

# Pelican - our test project
__(It’s actually a pretty neat Python powered static site generator with support for Markdown and reST)__

## Done so far:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Create a new branch to add features
3. Break the code (since I want to show you have to find the fuckup)

# git bisect - Indroducion

## When to use?

* When your build is not building anymore and you have no clue why

## What does it?

* git bisect can automatically crawl your commits and will show you, where the (first) build-breaker was introduced

## What do we have to know?

* A (healthy|good) commit from which git starts to look for a failure

---

# git bisect - Usage

1. Mark the last known good commit: `git bisect start HEAD e35ca1d`
.left[![](git2.png)]
  * `HEAD` is where the build fails.
  * `e35ca1d` ist the last known healthy commit. This can be a commit, a branch or a tag
2. Let `git bisect` run the the build automatically: `git bisect run ../buildtest.sh`
  * `buildtest.sh` runs the build or the part of the build, which breaks the build. The script should be outside the `git` repository.

---

# git bisect - Output

.left[![](git3.png)]

`git bisect` creates a temp-branch and succesfully blamed the bad commit

Now you know where the bug was introduced :)

---

# git blame - Who fucked up?

Because it’s nice to know, who introduced the problem, `git` offers you all the tools to `blame` the commiter.

`git blame` can tell you who made the last change for each LoC:

Now you know who will need to pay your next lunch :)

---

# Last but not least: git cherry-pick

`git cherry-pick` does exactly the thing you think.

Image you have fixed a bug in a branch, which was not merged to `master`. 

You can simply run:
.center[```
git cherry-pick ${commit}
```]

and the commit will automatically be `merged` into your current branch. :)
